.BI Builtins
This section lists the builtin commands which are builtin because they need to perform some operation that can't be performed by a separate
process.  In addition to these, there are several other commands that may be builtin for efficiency (e.g.  printf(1), echo(1), test(1), etc).

.TP
cd  [directory]
Switch to the specified directory (default HOME).  If an entry for CDPATH appears in the environment of the cd command or the shell
variable CDPATH is set and the directory name does not begin with a slash, then the directories listed in CDPATH will be searched for
the specified directory.  The format of CDPATH is the same as that of PATH.  If a single dash is specified as the argument, it will be
replaced by the value of OLDPWD.  The cd command will print out the name of the directory that it actually switched to if this is dif
ferent from the name that the user gave.  These may be different either because the CDPATH mechanism was used or because the argument
is a single dash.
.TP
exit [exitstatus]
Terminate the shell process.  If exitstatus is given it is used as the exit status of the shell; otherwise the exit status of the preceding command is used.
.TP
env
